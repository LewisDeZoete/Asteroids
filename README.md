# Asteroids Godot Project
### Requirements:
- Godot
- Obsidian
- GitHub account


## Where to start?
### Assets
First, download all the code on this GitHub. You can do this by pressing the `<>Code` dropdown in the top right hand corner.

Next, [follow this link to the Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jGch2o3lQNIh7PWKLNI5sTQ6dMmGRlB6?usp=drive_link) where all the game assets are stored. I called the folder sprites, just drop it into the main project folder so the structure looks like:

```
Project_folder
 |
 |--Diary
 |
 |--Scenes
 |
 |--Scripts
 |
 |--Sprites
```

### Obsidian
I'm assuming you've got Obsidian downloaded and installed on your computer. If you've never opened a vault before, Obsidian should open to a prompt to create or open a vault. If you *have* opened a vault vefore, you just need to navigate to the bottom left corner of the screen to the little keyhole icon and click that.

Select the option to `Open folder as vault`, then navigate into the project folder and simply select the `Diary` folder. 

You should now see the few notes I've already gotten started on in the folder panel on the left hand side in Obsidian. If not, send me a message. I'd recommend toying around with this interface, it's pretty easy to navigate but markdown takes a tiny bit of getting used to. If you want to make a document look prettier, someone on the internet has almost certainly tried to do the same thing; so Google it!


### Git tutorial
There's a tutorial on how to use Git in the file `git-intro.ipynb`. This is a JupyterNotebook so you can either open it in an IDE or online through the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org), but this weekend I'll try and simplify this tutorial into just the simplest elements and how you can contribute to the code.
